# Project_Adam

This is a project for processing video's and classifying them via activity recognition with CNN & LSTM/RNN based upon an Inception 3 framework and TensorFlow. It will also aim to use the same video to produce 3d pose estimation and YOLO.

The ultimate goal of project adam is to use this framework to record an athlete performing certain techniques, assign them to a class (0-9; 0 is worst 9 is the best), and then process the same video stream through a series of different classification problems that I will define correctly later. Then we will parse the processed videos together to create a profile of the athlete on a given day.

Once we get the core mechanics working, we will focus on optimizing and improving the prediction accuracy. Maybe even create supporting tools and structures around this. I will showcase any developments on my end around this work to the community.

Please feel free to contact me directly at derek.m.kane@gmail.com regarding the aim of this project and I certainly appreciate any contrinutions to the effort. Knowledge is power and lets work together to figure this out. Many different applications can come out of this and lets share the wealth... Carpe Diem!
