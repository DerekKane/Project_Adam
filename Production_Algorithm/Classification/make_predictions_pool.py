"""
Go through all of our images and save out the pool layer
representation of our images. This is not a prediction, but rather the
convolutional representation of features that we can then pass to an
RNN. The idea is that later we'll add an RNN layer directly onto
the CNN. This gives us a way to test if that's a good strategy
before putting in the work required to do so.
